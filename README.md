Hangman game

<p>This is a version of the classic letter guessing game called Hangman. You are shown a set of blank letters that match a word and you have to guess what these letters are to reveal the hidden word.You guess by choosing letters on the keyboard. If you pick a letter that is in the word, that letter is revealed from the blank letters; however, if you pick a letter that is not in the word, then a stickman is slowly drawn. With each wrong letter guess, the man is drawn more and more. When the man is finished, he is hung and the game is lost. This is why the game is called 'Hangman'. If you can reveal all the letters in the word before the man is hung then you are successful and the full word is revealed.</p>

<p>In order to make the game easier, repeated wrong guesses do not count as errors and do not draw the man. When that happens an announcement will appear, ""You've already guessed".</p>

<p>I hope you have fun playing this game and that you can learn or improve your English at the same time. Leave any comments below.</p>
